## EmpathyBot ü§ñ‚ù§Ô∏è

[cite\_start]**EmpathyBot** is a chatbot prototype designed to analyze a user's emotions from text and provide kind, empathetic responses[cite: 19]. [cite\_start]It was developed as part of a 6-hour high-priority task to demonstrate AI-driven emotional intelligence[cite: 8, 9]. [cite\_start]The bot uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with few-shot prompt engineering to select and frame appropriate replies from a large response corpus[cite: 20].

[cite\_start]This project was built entirely in **Google Colab** and includes a web-based chat interface[cite: 10]. [cite\_start]The main goal is to create a functional demo for potential applications in mental health support or customer service[cite: 9].

## üöÄ Key Features

  * [cite\_start]**Emotion Detection**: The bot uses a pre-trained model to accurately detect user emotions such as happiness, sadness, and anger from their text inputs[cite: 19, 24].
  * [cite\_start]**Advanced RAG System**: It employs `Sentence-Transformers` to create text embeddings and **FAISS** for efficient retrieval of the top 3 most relevant response templates from the corpus[cite: 46, 48, 97, 101].
  * [cite\_start]**Few-Shot Prompting**: To ensure responses sound natural, the system uses a few-shot prompting technique that combines the retrieved templates with a prompt based on the detected emotion[cite: 20, 108].
  * [cite\_start]**Web Interface**: The prototype features a simple chat interface built with **Streamlit**[cite: 10, 50], allowing for real-time interaction. [cite\_start]A **FastAPI** RESTful API is an alternative deployment option[cite: 10, 51].
  * [cite\_start]**Safety First**: All responses are designed to be safe and positive[cite: 12]. [cite\_start]Every reply also includes a disclaimer: "I'm not a therapist; please seek professional help for serious issues"[cite: 12].

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get your local instance of EmpathyBot up and running.

**1. Clone the Repository**
[cite\_start]You'll need to clone the project repository, named `empathybot-[your-initials]`, to your local machine[cite: 13].

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/empathybot-[your-initials].git
cd empathybot-[your-initials]
```

**2. Install Dependencies**
[cite\_start]Install all the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file[cite: 141].

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Run the Application**

## üìù Project Notes & Reflections

[cite\_start]Here are some brief notes on the project's development process and outcomes, completed in **5.5 hours**[cite: 143].

  * [cite\_start]**What Worked Well**: The emotion detection was solid, thanks to the effectiveness of the pre-trained `bhadresh-savani/distilbert-base-uncased-emotion` model from Hugging Face[cite: 69, 92, 143]. [cite\_start]Using existing models and datasets was key to meeting the tight 6-hour deadline[cite: 11, 135].

  * [cite\_start]**Challenges**: The main challenge was curating a sufficiently large and diverse response corpus from the `empathetic_dialogues` dataset within the limited time[cite: 58, 143]. [cite\_start]Ensuring every response template was kind and safe also required careful manual review[cite: 137].

  * **Suggestions for Future Work**:

      * [cite\_start]**Expand the Corpus**: The bot's responses could be improved by using a larger and more varied corpus of empathetic templates[cite: 143].
      * [cite\_start]**Implement Conversation Memory**: The current version doesn't support multi-turn conversation memory, which was explicitly excluded from the scope[cite: 39]. Adding this feature would allow for more context-aware and meaningful interactions.
      * [cite\_start]**Enhance Safety Protocols**: For risky inputs like mentions of self-harm, a more robust system could be implemented to immediately provide a helpline suggestion instead of a standard empathetic response[cite: 138].
